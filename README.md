# hospitalrun-dblisteners
CouchDB listeners for HospitalRun.
These database listeners look for chanages in the CouchDB databases used by HosptialRun.  They are used by the [HosptialRun server](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-server) for HospitalRun deployments.  They are also used by [HosptialRun frontend](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend) when using [Ember CLI](http://ember-cli.com/) in a development environment.
